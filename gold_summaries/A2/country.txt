Most of these tweets questions the effectiveness of the Chinese and Russian vaccines. Regarding the Russian vaccines, a common thread in the Tweets was that you cannot trust the Russians. They are planning to wage war against the rest of the world and kills us with their vaccine. Some questioned why Putin has not gotten his Russian vaccine yet if it’s so effective. Other tweets also suggested that the leaders and politicians of countries that have developed vaccines should demonstrate their safety by being the first people to get their vaccines. The Chinese vaccines were also questioned as to their safety and true intent. Some Tweets suggested the Chinese vaccine will give you Covid and like the Russians are trying to do, the Chinese are also trying to wage war against other countries with their vaccine. One Tweet mentioned that Chinese manufacturing is shoddy and not transparent at all, and we should certainly not trust their vaccine manufacturing. Another Tweet suggested that American pharmaceuticals were using Europeans as lab rats for their clinical trials instead of testing on their own citizens. The alleged Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci connection and investments in Chinese laboratories and pharmaceuticals mentioned in several Tweets suggested they had evil intentions. Another Tweet suggested waiting at least six months after vaccination began to see what kinds of side effects are reported. While most of the Tweets were about the Russian and Chinese vaccines, several mentioned the production of vaccines in India. One Tweet suggested the Indian vaccine is a poor copycat of another country’s vaccine and is not safe to use.
