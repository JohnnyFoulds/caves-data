The main theme of this tweet set are people voicing doubts about the Covid-19 vaccines, often of a conspiracy nature. Some of these doubts are based on legitimate aspects of the vaccines, such as the fact some were developed using fetal tissue, but most are completely unfounded. The tweets claim the vaccines do many harmful things, from containing nanobots or chips that would be used for tracking or mind control, to rewriting a person's DNA. Many suggest the inclusion of heavy metals or other exotic ingredients will cause long term harm to one's health, or induce conditions such as autism. Many object to the vaccines on the moral basis because they were developed using, or allegedly include, fetal tissue. These objections often are of a religious nature, and may cite church leaders who have voiced opposition to the use of the vaccines. Others object to the new nature of the MRNA technology used in the new vaccines, or cast doubt on the accelerated testing the vaccines are undergoing. 
The tweets harshly criticize the pharmaceutical companies, specifically Moderna, Phizer, Johnson & Johnson, and AstraZeneca, claiming their vaccines are unsafe and often ascribing bad intent motives ranging from making money to trying to control or just kill people for population control. Bill gates is frequently mentioned as someone behind the conspiracy to include tracking or mind control chips or nanobots in the vaccines. Many of the tweets are directed at President Trump, urging him to stope the vaccine development and look at the alleged issues with the vaccines.
