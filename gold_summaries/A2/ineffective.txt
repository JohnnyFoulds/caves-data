In summarizing these tweets, there are people who actually believe that a vaccine must completely immunize every single person who received it from getting Covid-19 ever again in the future. They believe that any percentage of effectiveness less than 100% - whether 50%, 60%, 80%, or even 90% or 95% as stated within the tweets – indicates a failure of the system and by all involved in developing, promoting, or rolling out the vaccine. They blame virtually everyone – from entire governments, politicians, health agencies, drug companies, and individual business people. The trend of the tweets seems to express that we would be better off without the vaccine, just allow everyone to get sick on their own, and then become ‘immune’ to the virus. It is unfortunate that these small-minded people do not see the vaccine as just one large tool against this horrible pandemic and that the rest is up to us as individuals to protect ourselves and others. They expect to simply be handed the solution by someone else. They also don’t see the toll that those who do get sick (often unvaccinated) are having on our healthcare systems by overwhelming the facilities.
