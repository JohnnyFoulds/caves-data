This set of tweets was focused on the current COVID19 pandemic, specifically about the production, safety, and mandate of vaccines against COVID19. The tweets focused on skepticism about safety of the vaccines, especially those produced by Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna; and promoted the idea that these companies were pushing unnecessary vaccines in a scheme to make enormous profits while securing protected legal status to not be sued for any adverse outcomes. The second (equally-dominant) theme was that funders of these vaccines (specifically Bill Gates, but also the NHS/FDA/CDC/NIH and Anthony Fauci by name) were part of a global conspiracy to invent a virus in order to inject people for population control or genetic editing (as well as become rich off of forced vaccinations). A third, and lesser, theme is religious conspiracy rhetoric that these vaccines are somehow related to judeo-christian hell/demons, or that that Donald Trump is working behind the scenes to bolster natural immunity and alternative therapies like hydroxychloroquine (and the notion that this is life-saving work which will produce less casualties than the vaccinations).
