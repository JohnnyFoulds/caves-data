The COVID-19 vaccines have been criticized for being rushed and dangerous due to potential side effects, allergic reactions, and interactions with other vaccines or chemicals. Some think that the mRNA vaccines alter a person's DNA and they worry about how it will affect fertility or pregnancy in the future. Pharmaceutical companies are also seen as untrustworthy because of past black marks on their reputation and the fact that they are for-profit companies. Similarly, some people have come under question if they have ties to company profits or shares or are a member of the board of the company. Testing is also an issue as the initial sample sizes were seen as relatively small and they may not have been tested on animals before going to human trials.  The speed with which the vaccines have been rolled out is a cause of concern for some, as other diseases the world has been trying to tackle are still around.  Consent is also an issue, as forced vaccinations or vaccination passports make it so that people feel forced to take a vaccine they do not believe is safe. Some people point to past vaccines for other disease outbreaks like swine flu where the vaccine allegedly caused narcolepsy in some and SARS where re-exposure to the disease caused a more severe reaction. Some also believe that the virus was engineered and the vaccine is a means of controlling people who are desperate for a cure.
