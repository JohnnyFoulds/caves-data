These tweets show how many people are living in a frightening scenario in their own minds. They come from both sides of the conservative/progressive political systems. They hate the vaccine because of Trump, or because of Boris Johnson, or because of Modi, or because of Bill Gates - or because of Satan! They are just unhinged, illogical and unhappy people. Living with their thoughts must really hurt. They think the vaccines were rushed through unsafely. 
They believe this is an attempt to create a "New World Order" and is some massive conspiracy either by right wing governments or left wing governments. (Like, we can't agree on much of anything, how would a conspiracy of this complexity even be possible?) They think the virus was created just fool us all and give power to those they fear.
