The covid 19 pandemic is over exaggerated. And vaccinating everyone against covid 19 is biased. people who do not want to be vaccinated cannot be vaccinated by force. this is a blow to our constitutional rights. The authorities need to step back from this tyrannical practice immediately. There is also implicit information about the effectiveness of vaccines. The declared results are not sufficient. In addition, the number of people who get worse after vaccination is quite high. Influenza is an important disease in the world and it is a virus. There is also a flu vaccine, but it is not mandatory. Developing a vaccine is a very laborious and long-term process, but in this case, vaccine developers do not even take responsibility for their work. It tells us that we cannot be vaccinated. There are many ingredients in the vaccine. If one of those ingredients develops an anaphylactic reaction against me, who will be responsible? Restricting citizens who do not want to be vaccinated from opportunities such as travel and entertainment, especially basic needs, is an unfair and constitutional blow. human rights are ignored. Also, covid cells can enter our body and live there. but it won't hurt us all
