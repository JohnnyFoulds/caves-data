The tweet set shows common concerns related to the Covid 19 vaccines. A large portion of tweeters express are skeptical of the vaccines due to the amount of money Pfizer, Astro-Zeneca, and Moderna are making based on them. There is the feeling they are pushing vaccination to make profit rather than make people healthy. There are multiple tweets regarding the billions of dollars these companies are bringing in with the vaccines. There are some questionable stock trades by senior pharma executives that cause suspicion. There is also concern that the vaccine companies rushed the testing of their vaccines and  cannot be sued if their vaccines hurt patients. Some tweeters site previous lawsuits and issues with Pharmaceutical companies and regulators that show possible collusion/corruption. There is also considerable skepticism around Bill Gates and his role and motivations in vaccine development and distribution. Some feel that since he is known for saying there are too many people on the planet, there must be some nefarious reason why he is wanting to see everybody vaccinated.
