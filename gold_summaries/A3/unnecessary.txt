The feelings on the vaccinations are diverse - even among those on the same side of the argument. Of those who oppose, many use information that is either barely understood, or intentionally truncated, focusing on a phrase or, in some cases, even a word or two.
Others oppose because of associations - some tout Pfizer as being evil, and Moderna as not. Some claim all Big Pharma is evil and only doing this for the money, where others see Moderna as a pawn of Bill Gates, who is trying to take over the world through vaccines (or vaccine passports, as several mentioned.)  
Multiple sources are adamant about not taking any vaccination, ever - without putting any details behind that.  Sadly, these elements are not open to change nor even discussion and are not conducive to any advancement in the conversation.
All sorts of misinformation, and sometimes outright lies (only 1 in 50 million get COVID) are being espoused as fact
In short, the majority of people quoted are not remotely invested in having an actual discussion about this, whether it be for political reasons, loyalty to a politician, hatred for Big Pharma, or other reasons.
