The vast majority of these tweets state something about either the efficacy of the vaccine or the length of protection you can expect to receive from them. Many people seem confused about the vaccines work and they don't trust their government nor the scientists tasked with making the vaccines. A lot of people seemed to think that getting vaccinated is pointless because the vaccines aren't 100% effective. They seem to expect a one-dose magic cure. They think that because you can still potentially get covid after being vaccinated that there is no good reason to do it. They don't seem to understand how the virus can mutate through the unvaccinated and become resistant to the vaccines. They think if someone is vaccinated they shouldn't care if anyone else is. Many of these people think the vaccine has become politicized and that their government is urging they get vaccinated so they can win their upcoming elections. The majority of these people really don't care about their neighbors, about the people who have compromised immune systems and aren't able to get vaccinated themselves. These tweets were mainly written by very selfish people who want to believe everything is a conspiracy theory rather than doing the right thing for their fellow countrymen and the world as a whole.
