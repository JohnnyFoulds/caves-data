The coronavirus vaccine mandates are not okay because it is the right of every human being to make decisions for their own bodies. COVID-19 shot mandates take away those decisions and that's not something that anyone should be okay with because what will they mandate next? Microchips being put into your body? Bill Gates and Anthony Fauci are the main people who have been trying to force this issue. Those guys should not be trusted since they are aligned with Astrazeneca, Moderna and Pfizer and all of them are happily lining their pockets with cash because of the vaccines so it's no wonder that they want the vaccines to be mandated. It has been shown that natural immunity is the best way to fight against this virus and since the vaccine doesn't prevent you from getting the virus no one should be forced against their will to take the shot. The virus was eventually going to make it's way around to the majority of people in the world and doctor's even want the plasma of people who have had COVID-19 for the antibodies. They inject the antibodies into people who have COVID-19 and are suffering with severe symptoms. Now that's a treatment that we can get behind just like people being given Ivermectin however we would never suggest that those treatments be mandated. People need to wake up and take their rights back. Vaccine mandates are just not acceptable.
