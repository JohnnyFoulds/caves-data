These tweets are highly political and show distrust for the government and big pharma. It seems that many people are misinformed about the vaccine and believe it is a money making scheme or the live virus in the vaccine that will make them sick. Many people claim that the flu is more deadly than Covid, and that masking and vaccines don't work, or else Covid would already be gone. Although people are relying on herd immunity, and quoting mortality rates being extremely low, they do not seem to understand that the amount of active infections should be accounted for when talking about mortality. Some people say that the vaccines have killed their loved ones, or made them very ill and that is their reasoning for refusing to take the vaccine. Overall, many of these people are conspiracy theorists and gravely misinformed about this pandemic. People who tweeted also seem to think that unless you're old and dealing with co-morbidities, that you're more than safe. They likened the severity of Covid to being less than the flu. The people who did believe in a cure, believed in unsubstantiated drugs over the vaccine. These tweets show that education about the disease and the vaccines is low and misunderstood, there is hysteria pertaining to mandates of all kinds, mask, vaccine and even testing.
