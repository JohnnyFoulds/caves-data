The tweets that I read discussed the COVID-19 vaccine, and how many people felt about it. Several of the tweets stated that people were not willing to take the vaccine because it had been fast tracked and they were not going to be used as guinea pigs for a new vaccine.
There has been 40 years  of research on HIV with no vaccine made, 100 years of Cancer research with no vaccine made, and centuries of research on the common cold, but no vaccine has been made. Surprisingly though, after only 9 months they have made a COVID vaccine. Another interesting point that was made in the tweets was the different company information. A tweet made the statement that Merck abandoned making the COVID vaccine development stating that it was impossible to create. Also, in one of the other tweets it stated that Moderna had never made a vaccine for humans before. Some of the tweets blamed Trump for rolling out the vaccine for political reasons. Also, there were several tweets made that mentioned worries about the many different side effects that the untested vaccine could have. Many people think that the vaccine was pushed through so fast to make a lot of money for some of the big pharma companies, and some of the big investors like Bill Gates.
