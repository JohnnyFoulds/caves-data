Authors of these tweets are vaccine skeptics who believe that COVID-19 vaccines pose a greater threat to them than the virus itself. Some of these authors do not even believe in the existence of COVID-19, and many believe that vaccines were created by malevolent entities who wish to harm, kill, or sterilize the human population. Many of these tweets reference cases, real or otherwise, of death or illness following vaccination. Rare or fictional cases of death following a vaccine are treated as hard proof that vaccines are highly dangerous, while deaths from COVID-19 are ignored or dismissed as fabrications. Some of these tweets attack pharmaceutical companies or attribute malicious intent of vaccination to other figures, such as Bill Gates. Some authors express trust in other medications made by pharmaceutical companies as unproven treatments for COVID, and some even seem to possibly trust vaccines created in other countries, like Russia. Yet these same people are highly suspicious of vaccines developed by American pharma companies, often even believing that the vaccines were developed with the deliberate intent to cause harm. The authors of these tweets are highly confident in their own "research" and believe that they are smarter and more "in the know" than people who are choosing to get vaccinated.
