The authors of these tweets are vaccine skeptics who attribute their skepticism to the vaccine country of origin. Most of these authors seem to be anti-vaxxers who are looking for an excuse not to take a vaccine. In these tweets, the excuse they point to is the real or perceived country of vaccine development. The tweets express a refusal to take a vaccine developed in various countries, including Russia, China, India, and the United States. Authors allege that these countries either have nefarious reasons for creating the vaccines or are wanting to use vaccine recipients as guinea pigs. Some authors believe that governments want harm, kill, or sterilize the human population. Some of these tweets cite specific fears for refusal, such as supposed population control efforts by entities distributing and promoting vaccines. Some specific individuals -- such as Vladimir Putin, Bill Gates, Justin Trudeau, and Donald Trump -- are targets of these vaccine skeptics who say that these individuals cannot be trusted.
