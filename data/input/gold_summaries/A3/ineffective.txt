The vast majority of these tweets are about vaccine skepticism. One tweet that comes to mind compared the effectiveness of one of the vaccines to the case fatality rate of the virus, assuming that the seventy percent or whatever effectiveness was a less attractive option than the ninety nine percent survivability of the virus. Obviously one should be able to see that a vaccine offers ADDITIONAL protection, making one even LESS likely to die. It is not one or the other: survive seventy percent of the time if you take the vaccine; OR survive ninety nine percent of the time without. There's a general hint of conspiracy with all of these as well. The government is lying to you. The virus is not as dangerous as they are indicating. And if they are lying about that, what else aren't they telling us? Then you get into nefarious characters like Bill Gates. Somehow he gets tied to Anthony Fauci. These people are really after some sort of population control. All of the big governments and politicians are in on it, like Boris Johnson. There is clearly a great mistrust, or even distrust, of the institutions. They can be scientific, political, health related, or whatever else. But whatever they seem to say, there is a strong sense of push back, mostly because they have ulterior motives.
