Among the opinions given / sentiments expressed are:- 
The approval of these suites of vaccines were rushed by President tRump in order to boost his chances for re-election.
Individuals who have taken the vaccines already, who have suffered adverse reactions or have even died, are not eligible for recourse against manufacturers, per Government.
There is suspicion / skepticism regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, as weighed against the reality, research (allegedly) has been ongoing, for much longer, for protection / cures for common colds, HIV, influenza, etc., with no solid results as of now.
No vaccines are needed for people who "are not at risk" of death from coronavirus (2019), thus it is silly to risk the jab.
There has not been enough proper testing done to ensure no one suffers side effects from the vaccines.
Those who are against inoculation, assert they do not wish to be anyone's guinea pig.
Inadequate testing / validation of these vaccines may very well lead to a worsening of the ailment that the manufacturers claim to be reducing.
This is another attempt to Bill Gates &co. to try to reduce the world's population.
Some people, already inoculated, have gone on to incur serious allergic reactions.
Big Pharma is more than happy to capitalize on an opportunity (a catastrophe) to make themselves more money, no matter the consequence.
It is possible, this pandemic is one that is man-made in its origins.
These vaccines are a mechanism to "permanently alter one's DNA" / "render recipients sterile\infertile".
