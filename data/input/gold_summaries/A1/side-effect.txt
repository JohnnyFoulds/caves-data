Many of these tweets contained misinformation casting doubt on the efficacy of Covid vaccines, suggested they are part of a government conspiracy and some even doubted the existence of Covid 19. Some of the tweets were strictly factual with information from the CDC or European Union about side effects and the pausing of the clinical trials due to those side effects. The misinformation used anecdotal evidence of a handful of patients having certain side effects without mentioning how many people have not had serious side effects. They are lacking in context and are making very small samples appear to be significant. Other tweets alleged that the vaccines are an attempt by Bill Gates and George Soros to sterilize people to reduce overpopulation. Some claimed the vaccines contain live viruses which they do not. Others are strictly anti-vaxxers who believe it is unsafe to have any vaccines. Other claims included that it would alter your DNA, that the vaccine side effects are as bad as getting Covid and that it is a "fake" virus. Some of the factual tweets relayed information about real, but rare, side effects such as blood clotting and heart inflammation. Some expressed concerns about the rushed clinical trials which typically take many years and were concerned that not enough testing was done to determine the long-term effects of vaccination. There were also concerns about the limited liability that drug manufacturers were given by governments in return for the rapid development of the vaccines. There was a wide variety of opinions and facts from official sources and questionable, anecdotal evidence.
