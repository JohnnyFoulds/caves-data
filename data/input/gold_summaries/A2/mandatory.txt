Even people who are not typically anti-vaccine are against the covid-19 vaccine. There is a sentiment that the science has not been proven and that it is going against the typical process. There is worry that there will be vaccine mandates that will escalate out of control such as kids not being able to go to school without a covid-19 virus. It is believed that vaccine mandates are completely unethical, unconstitutional, and some are even comparing mandatory vaccine passports to events that occured during the nazi germany period. They believe those who are unvaccinated will eventually be placed into internment camps. Some feel if you have already had covid then you could be tested for antibodies, and if you already have them, that you should not be forced to get a vaccine. Some say if you are vaccinated, then you already have the protection you need, and so a passport is not necessary. It is viewed as discriminatory to people who exist in high risk groups for the vaccine such as those who experience severe allergies. Actions taken by the UK government such as advancing plans to require vaccine passports to travel are seen as a warning of what is to come in the future. Vaccines are also extremely unpopular in Russia with an 87% rate of russians not wanting the vaccine. People believe the Russian government is going to extort them in order to force them to take it regardless. Overall, people feel that their fundamental constitutional freedoms are being stepped on when it comes to vaccinations.
