There is a lot of hesitancy over COVID-19 vaccines due to reports of blood clots developing in people shortly after receiving various brands of vaccinations. Despite the probability of dying from blood clotting from a vaccine being 800 times less likely than dying from blood clotting from the coronavirus itself, people have become increasingly terrified of the possible side effects of the vaccine. Individual cases of people who have died after receiving the vaccine has caused an amplifying effect on the concerns people already had and has led to serious paranoia around the vaccination. People think that their government is out to get them. Not only the government, but also the media and wealthy figures such as Bill Gates. There is confusion around the mRNA technology which is leading to many conspiracies like believing it uses nano technology to alter a human's data or take control of their brain. It is believed that the immune system of the recipient of the vaccine will be weakened from it. There is a sentiment that young people are at a low enough risk of being harmed by the symptoms of covid-19, that it is actually worse to get vaccinated. People believe the symptoms from getting the vaccine outweigh those from the virus.
